License and source information for external tools

Major parts of the software use components from The Apache Software Foundation

http://www.apache.org

The application relies heavily on spring

http://spring.io

The GUI is developed using SmartGWT. Some components of the commercial version
are used, so we cannot include these libraries. You can factor out these parts
(mainly the datasource for the ontology term picker) and use the GNU version
of SmartGWT.
